Christmas is here which means I’m spending time with my family which means I’m finding reasons not to spend time with my family which means I might as well write about Sorare. Here are some random thoughts.

The MLS offseason roster moves are just as exciting if not more exciting to me than regular season games.

## Fedor Smolov

Related: I would bet a six pack of beer on Fedor Smolov signing with the Chicago Fire. Smolov wants out of Russia, the Fire just got rid of Beric, and there’s no place that Eastern Europeans flock to like Chicago (OK Poles, not Russians, but close enough… it was all USSR at some point).

## SorareUsa

This SorareUsa twitter feed is a gem and I’m sure that access to this is a competitive advantage at the moment. Case in point:

- SorareUsa all but declares that Jeff Attinella is the Timbers #1 GK on 12/21

- A Jeff Attinella SR goes for 300 bucks on 12/22 (I bid on this, got distracted at the climbing gym, and then lost).

I think 300 bucks for a current starting GK SR is low. Either a) people are very confident that Portland will sign a better GK than Attinella or b) people have no idea Steve Clark is gone and Attinella is currently the best suited to start (e.g. they are not SorareUsa readers). I think it’s more b) than a) and there is a finite amount of time before non-SorareUsa readers become SorareUsa readers. It is absolutely wild to me that SorareUsa only has like 2K followers.

## MLS Power Rankings - Top 5

One of my sisters wants to watch Avatar the Last Airbender right now and my brother wants to talk about smoking weed with me. I would like to do neither and write down my projected rankings of the top 5 MLS teams instead.

1. **Nashville SC** - Nashville has the best center back in the league in Zimmerman and the 2nd best playmaker in Mukhtar. As of now, there are gaps in the Nashville lineup… McCarty is getting old, Zimmerman’s cohorts in the back 3 could be stronger (looking at you, Miller), and Sapong is a good not great CF IMO (it was pointed out to me after writing this that Ake Loba is waiting in the wings to take over from Sapong). But Nashville has $1M to work with from selling Johnston to Montreal and saved another $1M (and a DP spot) by letting go of Cadiz. My bet is they work in Loba for Sapong, splash on a DP at RB, and sign a solid CDM to slowly slide in for McCarty. Spending this money wisely is easier with a solid core already established. Right now they are not the best team in the league but they will be by February.

2. **New England Revolution** - The Revs return pretty much everyone minus Buchannon. I think we can expect to see pretty much what we saw last season, with a better defense (now Kessler + Farrell have a mentor in Gonzalez) and slightly less potent offense (Buchannon did single-handedly win some games last year). They will dominate the East again.

3. **Vancouver Whitecaps** - This is a surprise pick, but the Whitecaps were on fire down the stretch of last season, basically since Vanni Sartini became the head coach. I do not think this was a fluke. Aside from the fact that I love Sartini as a person, I think that he has done a great job with the team and it seems like they are genuinely happy under him. Brian White + Ryan Gauld will be one of the best CM/CF pairings in the league, and White will play for the national team by season’s end.

4. **Seattle Sounders** - This team is loaded with talent and a perennial contender. Yeimar/Roldan/Morris is one of the strongest cores in the league. This team can suffer from too much of a good thing… it’s not always the case that their talent works well together. See their dismal exit from the playoffs last year. However, they will simply overpower most teams.

5. **Sporting KC** - Another perennial contender who have players who know how to win games in the MLS. Beric will be reborn after leaving the dumpster fire that is the Chicago Fire and the pairing of Beric and Russell will be a top 5 pairing in the league. They need a CB to replace Ilie but my guess is that they will get one by February.

## Sorare API

Sorare keeps building out their API – https://github.com/sorare/api – It’s close to having everything needed to build a lowest-score-wins sorare game. (Missing the ability to get SO5 scores for a player, as far as I am aware, am I missing something?)

## Market Seasonality

My friend said it and it’s true.. I feel like an idiot for trading away martinez and barco before their pre-MLS-season bump.

Ok I need to go eat pancakes with people.
